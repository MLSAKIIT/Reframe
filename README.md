# Problem-Statements
1. Campus clubs are the heartbeat of college life — but they struggle with scattered communication, low visibility, and poor engagement. Students miss events, clubs lose traction, and the sense of community fades.

_**Club Discovery**_

- Swipeable card-style interface with tags, logos, and vibes (sportsy, cultural, techy). 
- AI-powered “For You” feed recommending clubs/events.
- AR badges to scan posters IRL and instantly join/RSVP.
  
_**Event Calendar**_

- Interactive grid/timeline view with color-coded clubs.
-	RSVP, add to personal calendar, or share to socials in one tap.
-	Event check-in via QR code for attendance tracking.

_**Join Requests**_

-	Smooth application flow with mini-bios + skill highlights.
-	Clubs can send personalized invites to active users.

_**Member Chat**_

-	Club-specific chatrooms with threads, polls, and reactions.

_**Profile Cards**_

2. Online shoppers crave personalized experiences but often get lost in endless product listings. Discovery feels generic, and the shopping journey lacks social connection and inspiration.

  - AI-driven “For You” feed based on browsing + social trends
  - Visual search (upload a photo / screenshot to find similar products)

_**Proposal Submission**_

  - Guided form with auto-suggested phrases for efficiency.
  - Preview mode so students see their proposal exactly as clients will.
  - Status tracking (Submitted → Seen → Shortlisted → Hired).
